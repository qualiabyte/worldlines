Axes Scene

This scene introduces basic elements of the worldlines program,
such as the axes grid and simultaneity plane, with a focus
on illustrating coordinate transformation.

A target particle is shown in oscillating motion relative to
stationary particles in the world frame.  As it accelerates,
its (x'ct') axis grid and (x'y') simultaneity plane are transformed
within the coordinates of the world frame.

To see events as in the coordinate space of the target particle's
current frame, activate the display transformations:

1) Click 'TOGGLE_SPATIAL_TRANSFORM'
2) Click 'TOGGLE_TEMPORAL_TRANSFORM'
