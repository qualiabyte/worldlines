Bell's Spaceship Paradox Scene

In this fun scene, you control a fleet of ships with the W A S D
keys. Each ship is modeled as an "idealized rigid body" (shown as
yellow trapezoids) - as if each ship were to perfectly retain its
shape within its rest frame while accelerating.

Events in this scene are shown in the reference frame of the front
ship in the fleet. After accelerating, each ship will retain its
shape in this frame (since all ships are moving with the same
velocity), but you will see that simultaneity is broken between
fleet members.

That is, moving in the x-direction, "current" events in the world
frame for ships in the back of the fleet are shifted "up" into
the future of the leading ship. Additionally, though each
ship's size and shape are retained, they become spaced further
apart!
