Length Contraction Scene

This scene shows how fixed lengths in the world frame
are contracted in the the rest frame of a moving particle.

It features a field of uniform particles, and a single
oscillating target particle. By default, events are shown
in the reference frame of this target.

As the particle accelerates, the intersections of the uniform
particle grid with the target's x'y' simultaneity plane shows
how the grid appears to be distributed in the moving frame.

Specifically, the grid contracts along the target's direction
of motion (here, along the x-axis). Thus, the intersections'
x-separation becomes much smaller at high speeds.

Meanwhile, events simultaneous for the target in the world
frame are shifted 'above' or 'below' the target's simultaneity
plane - into the future or past, depending on if they are in front
of or behind the particle along its direction of motion.
