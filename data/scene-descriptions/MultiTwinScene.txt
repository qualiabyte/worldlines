Multiple Twins Scene

This scene is similar to the Twin Paradox Scene,
but with multiple "B Twins" departing at different speeds.

The surface of "constant time" connecting equivalent clock ticks
between the departing twins is seen to be curved, an indication
that time in this simulation is indeed relative (rather than absolute)
between different frames of reference - and is velocity dependent.

This scene is fascinating to watch from the perspective of the B Twins.
(Try right-clicking any twin and select 'makeTargetParticle')

If you lower the 'timestep', 'restart' and then switch to B's frame,
you can see the see the change of reference frame at t_B = 50 s.
