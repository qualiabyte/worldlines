Twin Paradox Scene

This scene uses particles to illustrate the twin paradox.
Twin particles "A" and "B" begin at a common starting location.
Twin A remains at rest, while twin B departs at a constant speed.
Twin B later turns around at time τ_turn as measured in its frame.

The conundrum goes as follows:
If, as according to time dilation, “frames in relative motion
see each other’s clocks as advancing more slowly,” then what is
the relationship between the ages of the two twins in this scenario?

The ageDiff meter tracks their age difference in the world frame,
where ageDiff = ∆τ = τ_A − τ_B.

To replay the scene in B's frame of reference: 
1) Click 'RESTART' 2) Right click on B 3) Select 'makeTargetParticle'
