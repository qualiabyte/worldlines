\begin_layout Abstract
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Worldlines
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is an interactive visualization of Special Relativity which presents particle
 paths in a 3D slice (2 space + 1 time) of the 4D Minkowski spacetime.
 The displayed coordinate space can be changed between the world frame and
 the frame of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

target
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 particle by toggling the space and time components of the Lorentz transformatio
n for the currently targeted frame.
 Scenarios and phenomena presented include the twin paradox (time dilation),
 length contraction and Bell's spaceship paradox.
 Graphical elements include particle paths, coordinate axes, simultaneity
 planes and their particle intersections, pulsing clocks, and clock tick
 history.
 Scripted and free-exploration modes are available, with a focus on intuitive
 controls for accelerating to, and steering near, light speed.

Time Dilation & the Lorentz Factor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Special Relativity (SR) is fascinating because it suggests that some of
 the seemingly foundational aspects of normal experience (and the physical
 reality which underpins it) aren't quite so in general.
 The forward flow of time, which once seemed an inescapable constant, uniform
 for all observers, turns out to be completely dependent upon the relative
 velocity of entities.
 Frames of reference in relative motion record each other's clocks as advancing
 more slowly, as given by the time dilation factor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma\equiv dt/d\tau\text{ , the Time Dilation Factor}\]

\end_inset


\change_inserted 0 1272403714

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 0 1272806163
Here 
\begin_inset Formula $d\tau$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

 are infinitesimal time increments, where 
\begin_inset Formula $d\tau$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the proper time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 measured between events by a clock at rest in a given frame, and 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the time intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 between the same events given by the first clock, but as measured in another
 coordinate frame.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 gives the ratio of time intervals as measured by a pair of clocks in different
 frames.
\end_layout

The time dilation factor is given by the Lorentz term, which is crucial
 in SR:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma(v)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}\text{ , the Lorentz Factor}\]

\end_inset

Where 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 is the 
\change_deleted 0 1272805778
relative
\change_unchanged
 speed of one frame relative to another, and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is the speed of light.
 Because all objects with mass move slower than light, as their speed 
\begin_inset Formula $v<c$
\end_inset

 increases, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{1-v^{2}/c^{2}}<1$
\end_inset

 approaches 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, and thus

Universal Speed of Light and Velocity Addition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The speed of light, a constant according to SR, shatters another foundation
 of our experience - the idea that we can generally approach the velocity
 of objects moving relative to us by accelerating out of our old frame of
 reference.
 This is not true in the case of light, as time dilation conspires to ensure
 that our clocks slow down as we approach the velocity of photons (as seen
 from an external frame) so that they always seem to remain at 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 relative to us.

 of Galilean

concept of

\change_inserted 0 1272886100

Velocity Addition Example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 represents the speed of a light particle, and frame A moves away from B
 at half of lightspeed, then
\change_inserted 0 1274056219
 using geometrized natural units (here defining the unit velocity as the
 speed of light, with 
\begin_inset Formula $c=1$
\end_inset

)
\change_unchanged
 we have: 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{photon,A}=c=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{A,B}=0.5$
\end_inset

, so:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
u_{photon,B}=\frac{1+0.5}{1+1*0.5}=\frac{1.5}{1.5}=1\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is no surprise, since the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{B}=1$
\end_inset

 holds for any relative speed 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{A,B}$
\end_inset

 between the two frames when 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{A}=1$
\end_inset

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Length Contraction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just as time dilation describes how moving clocks are seen to run slower,
 length contraction in SR tells us that distances measured outside an object's
 rest frame appear contracted along the direction of motion.
 Like the proper time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, an object's proper length 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{0}$
\end_inset


\change_inserted 0 1272812452
 
\change_unchanged
measured in its frame of rest is related to the length 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 in general frames of motion by the Lorentz factor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
L=\frac{L_{0}}{\gamma}\]

\end_inset

With the proper length divided by 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma>1$
\end_inset

, we see the distance 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{0}$
\end_inset

 will be the longest seen in any frame.

For example, when drawing the axes basis and grid of a particle, the inverse
 transform corresponding to

 is used to map 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{basis_{rest}}$
\end_inset

 into the world frame:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
r_{basis_{world}}=L^{-1}\left(r_{basis_{rest}},\, v_{particle}\right)\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, any display transforms for the target particle are applied to the

The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $ct'$
\end_inset

 represents the particle's 3-velocity here through the (2+1) Minkowski space,
 analogous to the 4-velocity in real-world 4D spacetime.
 The point is that 
\begin_inset Formula $ct'$
\end_inset

 is always tangent to the particle's path, and shows where the particle
 will be if it keeps its current velocity.
 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $ct'$
\end_inset

 is notable because in SR, it is not generally perpendicular to the 
\begin_inset Formula $x'y'$
\end_inset

plane in all frames of reference.
 That is, space and time between different frames are mixed - motion along
 only along time (parallel to

Problem Setup:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose twin B departs at velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{B}$
\end_inset

 (say, 0.9 c) and begins its return at proper time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{turnaround,B}$
\end_inset

 (say, 50 s).
 If twin A remains at rest, we can find the age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{meet}$
\end_inset

 for each.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{meet,A}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finding twin B's age is straightforward:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\tau_{meet,B} & = & 2*\tau_{turnaround,B}\\
\tau_{meet,B} & = & 2*50s=100s\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, twin A ages by twice B's turnaround time - but in A's own frame:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tau_{meet,A}=2*t_{turnaround,A}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since twin B's local clock measures proper times 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{B}$
\end_inset

 which appear dilated when seen as 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{A}$
\end_inset

 for twin A at rest in the world frame, we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{A}=\gamma\tau_{B}\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
\tau_{meet,A}=2*t_{turaround,A}=2*(\gamma\tau_{turnaround,B})\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma=1/\sqrt{1-v_{B}^{2}/c^{2}}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma=1/\sqrt{1-0.9^{2}}=1/\sqrt{1-0.81}=1/\sqrt{0.19}=2.294\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So finally, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{meet,A}=2*2.294*50s=229.4s$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is reasonable, since 
\begin_inset Formula $229.4s>100s$
\end_inset

 giving 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{A}>\tau_{B}$
\end_inset

 as expected.
 For reference, their age difference is

\begin_layout Standard
The paradox is that each ship receives the same boost in the world frame
 - so the relative positions of each ship in the fleet is preserved; their
 relative acceleration is 'uniform' by definition.
 Similarly, the internals of any particular ship appears preserved to its
 inhabitants, who are in its rest frame, so the acceleration appears 'uniform'
 to them as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Back in the world frame, the length of each moving ship contracts - which
 would intuitively seem to indicate the distance between the ships increases
 in their frame.
 But if the distance between the ships is increasing, what happened to the
 'uniformity' of the acceleration observed within each ship?
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Further, if the relative distances within the fleet are preserved in the
 world frame, length contraction would seem to demand that this spacing
 would contract in the frame of the ships moving relative to those measurements.
 This seems to be resolved by the relativity of simultaneity, though; those
 world frame measurement event coordinates are contracted in the ship's
 new frame, although they're no longer simultaneous.
 We still have to address the rigidity though.

 The object's name and state is shown, and a selection reticle is added.
 Any menu actions selected will be applied to the currently selected particles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Camera rotation (Right Mouse click on Background)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\end_inset

.
 The target particle is followed by the camera, and can be accelerated with
 the keyboard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Accelerate the target particle
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use the arrow keys or W,A,S,D keys to boost the particle.
 Note: it's no use trying to accelerate driven particles - if a driven particle
 is the only target, try right clicking another particle in the scene, and
 make that the target.
 Also, turn on emissions to get a visual sense of the boost being applied
 to your targets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Activate Emissions

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Pulsing particle clocks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A bright light pulses with a frequency proportional to the rate of proper
 time currently elapses for it in the simulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Colored ticks are shown spaced at even proper time intervals along each
 particles path.
 Spacing is at powers of 10 s; the spacing exponent changes when 20 ticks
 are reached.
 The tick size slightly increases at each exponent change, as does the color.
 The corresponding intervals for each color are:

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Particle frame plane of simultaneity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The surface of constant time (corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $ct'=0$
\end_inset

) for each particle's current frame appears as a transparent plane defined
 by the 
\begin_inset Formula $x'y'$
\end_inset

 axes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Worldline intersections with target plane of simultaneity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Intersections between the each particle's path and the target particle's
 plane of simultaneity are displayed by a selectable glowing clock pulse.
 (The pulse timing is just the that of the particle in the current simulation
 step though, see: 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "enu:Intersection-clock-pulses-bug"

\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Particle frame axes basis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The axes basis for each particle's frame are displayed; mapped first into
 the world, and then display, coordinates.
 For the target particle, the labels 
\begin_inset Formula $(x',y',ct')$
\end_inset

 are displayed.
 Additionally, the basis for the simulation's world frame are displayed,
 labeled 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y,ct)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Particle frame axes coordinate grid
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The coordinate grid for the target particle and the origin can be activated
 by toggles under the main panel.
 Units are displayed in light-seconds -
\begin_inset Formula $ls$
\end_inset

.
 The coordinate grid spacing scales up relative to the distance from the
 kamera.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Gui Controls
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Pause
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stops the simulation for user inspection.
 When stopped, the control changes to Play.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Restart
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Restarts the currently active scene, keeping the the currently set control
 preferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Toggle Spatial Transform & Toggle Temporal Transform
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Toggles whether the space and time parts of the Lorentz transform are applied
 to the final display coordinates shown onscreen.
 With both off, all events are shown in world frame coordinates.
 With both on, the events are seen in the coordinates of the target particle;
 as observers in its rest frame would measure them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Timestep
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Timestep controls the simulation speed by changing the simulated interval
 per frame.
 The slider controls the number of seconds of simulation time (either in
 the world frame or target particle's frame) which pass per second of user
 time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
ProperTime Scaling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When active, the simulation timestep is multiplied by the time dilation
 factor of the target particle.
 Effectively, this lets you experience time as it passes for the targeted
 particle.
 For a particle moving at high velocity, rather than it's clock appearing
 to slow down, all other activity in the simulation is sped up.
 The effect can be pretty dramatic in combination with the clock pulses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
1-D Control
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This restricts user's control of boosts the target particle's velocity (via
 the keys W, A, S, and D) to the x-direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Show Rigid Bodies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Controls whether any rigid bodies (appearing as yellow polygons, as in Bell's
 Spaceship Scene) which may be attached to the particles are displayed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Use Emissions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Controls whether emissions are ejected as the user propels a target particle.
 Gives the user a sense of the direction the boost is being applied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Show Target & Origin Axes Grid
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shows or hides the respective axes grid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

About the Program
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Tools
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Environment: Processing, Java, OpenGL, Git
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Processing is a development environment and extension to Sun's Java programming
 language, focusing on providing ease of use with a minimalistic toolset
 for creative expression.
 It also provides the full power of the Java language (through the 1.4 syntax),
 the many third party libraries, and other pure Java classes.
 Processing supports OpenGL, accessible through the JOGL implementation
 of the C interface.
 Processing provides one-click export to PC, Mac, and Linux binaries - and
 to Java applets for web use.
 Git was used for source code management.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Libraries: VTextRenderer, ControlP5, Apache Math Commons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Processing has a great user community, forums, and reference docs.
 I've used two user-created libraries in particular - V*'s (Victor Martin's)
 VTextRenderer
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, for OpenGL text labels, one thing lacking in Processing; and Andreas Schlegel'

Known Bugs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These graphical details could be confusing:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Distance Measurement feature works on Windows and Linux, but has an unresolved
 graphical glitch on Mac OS X.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Intersection clock pulses match the timing of the head particles in the
 world frame.
 The timing is physically correct for the heads, but fixing the timing for
 the intersections needs an additional calculation.
 (Ie, just the elapsed propertime before the head catches up to the intersection
 for particles on straight paths; divide the head to intersection distance
 in the world frame by the length of the head's (2+1) 3-velocity).
