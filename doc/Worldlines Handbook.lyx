\begin_layout Abstract
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Worldlines
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is an interactive visualization of Special Relativity which presents particle
 paths in a 3D slice (2 space + 1 time) of the 4D Minkowski spacetime.
 The displayed coordinate space can be changed between the world frame and
 the frame of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

target
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 particle by toggling the space and time components of the Lorentz transformatio
n for the currently targeted frame.
 Scenarios and phenomena presented include the twin paradox (time dilation),
 length contraction and Bell's spaceship paradox.
 Graphical elements include particle paths, coordinate axes, simultaneity
 planes and their particle intersections, pulsing clocks, and clock tick
 history.
 Scripted and free-exploration modes are available, with a focus on intuitive
 controls for accelerating to, and steering near, light speed.

Introduction

\begin_layout Subsection
Time Dilation & the Lorentz Factor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Special Relativity (SR) is fascinating because it suggests that some of
 the seemingly foundational aspects of normal experience (and the physical
 reality which underpins it) aren't quite so in general.
 The forward flow of time, which once seemed an inescapable constant, uniform
 for all observers, turns out to be completely dependent upon the relative
 velocity of entities.
 Frames of reference in relative motion record each other's clocks as advancing
 more slowly, as given by the time dilation factor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma\equiv dt/d\tau\text{ , the Time Dilation Factor}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here 
\begin_inset Formula $d\tau$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

 are infinitesimal time increments, where 
\begin_inset Formula $d\tau$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the proper time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 measured between events by a clock at rest in a given frame, and 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the time intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 between the same events given by the first clock, but as measured in another
 coordinate frame.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 gives the ratio of time intervals as measured by a pair of clocks in different
 frames.
\end_layout

The time dilation factor is given by the Lorentz term, which is crucial
 in SR:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma(v)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}\text{ , the Lorentz Factor}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 is the speed of one frame relative to another, and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is the speed of light.
 Because all objects with mass move slower than light, as their speed 
\begin_inset Formula $v<c$
\end_inset

 increases, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{1-v^{2}/c^{2}}<1$
\end_inset

 approaches 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, and thus

 goes to positive infinity.

Thus, we can see how clocks at relativistic speeds are seen to advance at
 a reduced rate, as proper time intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

 in the clock's rest frame appear stretched according to the time dilation
 factor:

\begin_layout Subsection
Universal Speed of Light and Velocity Addition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The speed of light, a constant according to SR, shatters another foundation
 of our experience - the idea that we can generally approach the velocity
 of objects moving relative to us by accelerating out of our old frame of
 reference.
 This is not true in the case of light, as time dilation conspires to ensure
 that our clocks slow down as we approach the velocity of photons (as seen
 from an external frame) so that they always seem to remain at 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 relative to us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our inability to catch up with light is a special case of SR's contradiction
 of Galilean velocity addition; in SR, if we are interested in the velocity
 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 of an object, then finding the velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{B}$
\end_inset

 as measured in frame B with known velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{A}$
\end_inset

 as measured in frame A is no longer as simple as saying:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
u_{B}=u_{A}-v_{B,A}=u_{A}+v_{A,B}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula \[
\text{ Galilean velocity addition (not generally true)}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Where the notation 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{B}$
\end_inset

 reads 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 as measured in B
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{A,B}$
\end_inset

 reads 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the velocity of frame A as measured in B.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) Instead, we now have the following relation for parallel velocities:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
u_{B}=\frac{u_{A}+v_{A,B}}{1+u_{A}v_{A,B}/c^{2}}\text{ , velocity addition in SR}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Velocity Addition Example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 represents the speed of a light particle, and frame A moves away from B
 at half of 
\change_deleted 0 1282179579
lightspeed
\change_inserted 0 1282179579
light speed
\change_unchanged
, then
\change_inserted 0 1274056219
 using geometrized natural units (here defining the unit velocity as the
 speed of light, with 
\begin_inset Formula $c=1$
\end_inset

)
\change_unchanged
 we have: 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{photon,A}=c=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{A,B}=0.5$
\end_inset

, so:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
u_{photon,B}=\frac{1+0.5}{1+1*0.5}=\frac{1.5}{1.5}=1\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is no surprise, since the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{B}=1$
\end_inset

 holds for any relative speed 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{A,B}$
\end_inset

 between the two frames when 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{A}=1$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family roman
\series medium
\shape up
\size normal
\emph off
\bar no
\noun off
\color none
\begin_inset Formula \[
u_{B}=\frac{1+v_{A,B}}{1+1*v_{A,B}/1^{2}}=\frac{1+v_{A,B}}{1+v_{A,B}}=1\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Length Contraction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just as time dilation describes how moving clocks are seen to run slower,
 length contraction in SR tells us that distances measured outside an object's
 rest frame appear contracted along the direction of motion.
 Like the proper time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, an object's proper length 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{0}$
\end_inset

 measured in its frame of rest is related to the length 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 in general frames of motion by the Lorentz factor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
L=\frac{L_{0}}{\gamma}\]

\end_inset

With the proper length divided by 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma>1$
\end_inset

, we see the distance 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{0}$
\end_inset

 will be the longest seen in any frame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Coordinate Transformations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Lorentz equations which map event coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,t)$
\end_inset

 in frame 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $(x',t')$
\end_inset

 in frame 
\begin_inset Formula $S'$
\end_inset

 (moving in 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 along the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 direction at speed 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

) are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
x' & = & \gamma\,(x-vt)\\
t' & = & \gamma\,(t-vx/c^{2})\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Lorentz transformation can be expressed using a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{L}$
\end_inset

 which performs an operation mapping column vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x'}$
\end_inset

 (mixing the space and time components in the process in a rotation-like
 fashion).
 The equation for the transformed space-time component 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x'}$
\end_inset

 takes the general form:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{x'}=\mathbf{L}\mathbf{x}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Worldlines program, I've used the following explicit matrix form
 for the Lorentz transformation in the case of one-dimensional motion along
 the positive 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 direction:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
x'\\
y'\\
ct'\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\gamma & 0 & -\beta\gamma\\
0 & 1 & 0\\
-\beta\gamma & 0 & \gamma\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
x\\
y\\
ct\end{array}\right]\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
\text{Where: }\beta=v/c\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, the inverse Lorentz transform, which takes coordinates in the
 moving frame just described and maps them into the world frame, has the
 general form:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{x=}\mathbf{L^{-1}x'}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where I've used the following explicit matrix form:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
x\\
y\\
ct\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\gamma & 0 & \beta\gamma\\
0 & 1 & 0\\
\beta\gamma & 0 & \gamma\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
x'\\
y'\\
ct'\end{array}\right]\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is basically the standard configuration for the Lorentz transformation
 (but with the time coordinate listed last), in which the difference between
 the forward and inverse transformations is just a change in sign.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Since for a pair of frames with coordinate axes facing the same direction,
 relative velocities for the same action will have opposite sign, whether

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Use in Worldlines
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, when drawing the axes basis and grid of a particle, the inverse
 transform corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{particle}$
\end_inset

 is used to map 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{basis_{rest}}$
\end_inset

, the basis vectors of the particle's coordinate system in its rest frame,
 into the world frame:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
r_{basis_{world}}=L^{-1}\left(r_{basis_{rest}},\, v_{particle}\right)\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, any display transforms for the target particle are applied to the
 world coordinates of the vector:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
r_{basis_{display}}=L\left(r_{basis_{world}},\, v_{target}\right)\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{-1}$
\end_inset

 apply the regular or inverse Lorentz transformation matrix to the vector
 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, given velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In constructing 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 suitable for 2 dimensional velocities 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

, first an inverse rotation matrix for the particle's heading is applied;
 this is then multiplied by the 1D Lorentz matrix; last the regular rotation
 matrix is applied:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
L_{2D}(v)=R(\theta_{v})\, L_{1D}(v)\, R^{-1}(\theta_{v})\]

The Scenario
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the twin paradox, a pair of identical twins (A and B) begin at a common
 starting location.
 Twin B departs at a constant speed 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

, while twin A remains at rest.
 Some time later for twin B, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau_{B}$
\end_inset

, twin B reverses course and returns to A.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Effect and Observables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If each of the twins carry clocks to record the duration of their trip to
 be compared upon B's return, they will find a discrepancy between their
 measurements for the total elapsed time of the trip.
 That is, the elapsed time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{A}$
\end_inset

 observed by twin A (who remained at the initial point of departure) will
 always be greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{B}$
\end_inset

 for twin B:

\begin_layout Paragraph
Problem Setup:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose twin B departs at velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{B}$
\end_inset

 (say, 
\begin_inset Formula $0.9\, c$
\end_inset

) and begins its return at proper time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{turnaround,B}$
\end_inset

 (say, 
\begin_inset Formula $50\, s$
\end_inset

).
 If twin A remains at rest, we can find the age 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{meet}$
\end_inset

 for each.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{meet,A}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finding twin B's age is straightforward:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\tau_{meet,B} & = & 2*\tau_{turnaround,B}\\
\tau_{meet,B} & = & 2*50\, s=100\, s\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, twin A ages by twice B's turnaround time - but in A's own frame:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tau_{meet,A}=2*t_{turnaround,A}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since twin B's local clock measures proper times 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{B}$
\end_inset

 which appear dilated when seen as 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{A}$
\end_inset

 for twin A at rest in the world frame, we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
t_{A}=\gamma\tau_{B}\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
\tau_{meet,A}=2*t_{turaround,A}=2*(\gamma\tau_{turnaround,B})\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma=1/\sqrt{1-v_{B}^{2}/c^{2}}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma=1/\sqrt{1-0.9^{2}}=1/\sqrt{1-0.81}=1/\sqrt{0.19}=2.294\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So finally, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{meet,A}=2*2.294*50\, s=229.4\, s$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is reasonable, since 
\begin_inset Formula $229.4\, s>100\, s$
\end_inset

 giving 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{A}>\tau_{B}$
\end_inset

 as expected.
 For reference, their age difference is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau_{A-B}=129.4\, s$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Paragraph

\begin_inset Formula $v_{B}=0.9\, c$
\end_inset

.
 Twin B's age can be verified visually, with 10 segments between yellow
 clock history ticks, each marking an elapse of 
\begin_inset Formula $10\, s$
\end_inset

 for the particle's proper time.
 This gives 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{meet,B}=10*10\, s=100\, s$
\end_inset

 as required in the problem setup.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Twin A is selected, so its age is displayed beneath it.
 The result is 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{A,meet,program}=229.6\, s$
\end_inset

, which is very close to the 
\begin_inset Formula $229.4\, s$
\end_inset

 expected from the calculation.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2\, s$
\end_inset

 error is due to the time step used to update the particles, and the simple
 logic used to decide when twin B should begin its return and when the program
 should consider the particles to have met (pausing the scene).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The meter gives the user an intuitive sense for how the values are changing
 as the program runs in real-time.
 In this case, the sense the user should get is that the age difference
 accumulates smoothly, as seen in the world frame of twin A.

The Paradox

\begin_layout Standard
The

 in this scenario stems from the seeming discrepancy between the symmetry

 if A made such a turn (as even a lightspeed signal would not have yet reached
 him), or remained in place in accordance with the twin paradox scenario.

 dramatic, oscillating acceleration.
 The simple, dense spacing of the particle field is chosen in hope of leveraging
 the user's spatial intuition to help give a better feel for the nature
 of the transformations shown.
 Particle path intersections with the target's simultaneity plane take focus
 here, as we use them to show how distances between events

 is that each ship receives the same boost in the world frame - so the relative
 position
\change_deleted 0 1280232482
s
\change_unchanged
 of each ship in the fleet is preserved; their relative acceleration is
 'uniform' by definition.
 Similarly, the internals of any particular ship appears preserved to its
 inhabitants, who are in its rest frame, so the acceleration appears 'uniform'
 to them as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Back in the world frame, the length of each moving ship contracts - which
 would intuitively seem to indicate the distance between the ships increases
 in their frame.
 But if the distance between the ships is increasing, what happened to the
 'uniformity' of the acceleration observed within each ship?
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Further, if the relative distances within the fleet are preserved in the
 world frame, length contraction would seem to demand that this spacing
 would contract in the frame of the ships moving relative to those measurements.
 This seems to be resolved by the relativity of simultaneity, though; 
\change_inserted 0 1281902016
while 
\change_unchanged
those world frame measurement event coordinates are contracted in the ship's
 new frame, 
\change_deleted 0 1281902069
although 
\change_unchanged
they're no longer simultaneous
\change_inserted 0 1281902058
 in the fleet's new frame
\change_unchanged
.
 We still have to address the rigidity though.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This preservation of internal distances hinges on how well our idealized
 rigid bodies holds up.
 The idea of preservation of distances in the rest frame is known as Born
 rigidity.
 Where this rigidity is and is not preserved seems to be at the crux of
 the paradox.
 A resolution to the paradox seems to be simply that it's possible to imagine
 cases where the rigidity is and is not preserved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If one considers the fleet of ships as an entity, then Born rigidity is
 not preserved - though their positions are preserved in the world frame,
 Born rigidity is defined as preservation in the rest frame.

footnotetext{Note that careful observation while accelerating the fleet
 will show that, while the Lorentz transformations viewed from the rest
 frame of an accelerating ship are quite wild - 'pushing' equivalent moments
 of other fleet members arbitrarily far into the future or past - these
 equivalent events are never quite 'pushed' into the light cones of each
 other (since they are pushed about as far spatially away as they are shifted
 temporally).
 Thus, while the results seem at first unintuitive (almost non-sensical),
 no causal paradoxes are introduced.
 In this way, SR can be seen as offering different views of concrete situations,
 which together form a coherent whole.}

 With both on, the events are seen in the coordinates of the target particle;
 as observers in its rest frame would measure them.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Timestep
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Timestep controls the simulation speed by changing the simulated interval
 per frame.
 The slider controls the number of seconds of simulation time (either in
 the world frame or target particle's frame) which pass per second of user
 time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
ProperTime Scaling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When active, the simulation timestep is multiplied by the time dilation
 factor of the target particle.
 Effectively, this lets you experience time as it passes for the targeted
 particle.
 For a particle moving at high velocity, rather than it's clock appearing
 to slow down, all other activity in the simulation is sped up.
 The effect can be pretty dramatic in combination with the clock pulses.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Environment: Processing, Java, OpenGL, Git
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Processing is a development environment and extension to Sun's Java programming
 language, focusing on providing ease of use with a minimalistic toolset
 for creative expression.
 It also provides the full power of the Java language (through the 1.4 syntax),
 the many third party libraries, and other pure Java classes.
 Processing supports OpenGL, accessible through the JOGL implementation
 of the C interface.
 Processing provides one-click export to PC, Mac, and Linux binaries - and
 to Java applets for web use.
 Git was used for source code management.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Libraries: VTextRenderer, ControlP5, Apache Math Commons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Processing has a great user community, forums, and reference docs.

\begin_layout Standard
These graphical details could be confusing:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Intersection clock pulses match the timing of the head particles in the
 world frame.
 The timing is physically correct for the heads, but fixing the timing for
 the intersections needs an additional calculation.
 (Ie, just the elapsed propertime before the head catches up to the intersection
 for particles on straight paths; divide the head to intersection distance
 in the world frame by the length of the head's (2+1) 3-velocity).
